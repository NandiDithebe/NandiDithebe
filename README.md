Hi, Iâ€™m Nandi Dithebe.
Iâ€™m a Business IT Graduate. My aspiration is to become a BI Data Analyst. I'm intrigued by the value of data, as well as its impact on business decisions and, in turn, business growth. Contributing to the advancement of decision-making and predictive analysis within businesses through data and BI is the goal.
While skilled and knowledged in SQL and Business Analytics, Iâ€™m currently learning Power BI and Python for Data Analytics.
